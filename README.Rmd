## What does simfinapi do?
simfinapi wraps the https://simfin.com/ Web-API to make 'SimFin' data easily
available in R. 

*To use the package, you need to register at https://simfin.com/login and obtain
a 'SimFin' API key.*


## Example
In this example, we download some stock price data and turn these into a simple
plot.

```{r download_data}
# load package
library(simfinapi)

# download stock price data
tickers <- c("AMZN", "GOOG") # Amazon, Google
prices <- sfa_get_prices(tickers)
```

Please note that all functions in simfinapi start with the prefix `sfa_`. This
makes it easy to find all available functionality.

The downloaded data looks like this:

```{r show_data, echo=FALSE}
kable(head(prices))
```

Let's turn that into a simple plot.

```{r plot_data}
# load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

# create plot
ggplot(prices) +
  aes(x = date, y = close, color = ticker) +
  geom_line()
```

Suppose we would like to display the actual company name instead of the ticker.
To do so, we download additional company information and merge it to the
`prices` data:

```{r download_info}
company_info <- sfa_get_info(tickers)
```

`company_info` contains these information:

```{r show_info, echo=FALSE}
kable(company_info)
```

Now we merge both datasets and recreate the plot with the actual company names.

```{r recreate_plot}
# merge data
merged <- merge(prices, company_info, by = "ticker")

# recreate plot
ggplot(merged) +
  aes(x = date, y = close, color = company_name) +
  geom_line()
```

## Installation
From [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=simfinapi):
```{r install_cran, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("simfinapi")
```
If you want to try out the newest features you may want to give the development
version a try and install it from
[GitHub](https://github.com/matthiasgomolka/simfinapi):

```{r install_github, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/matthiasgomolka/simfinapi")
```

## Setup
Using simfinapi is much more convenient if you set your API key and cache
directory^[simfinapi always caches the results from your API calls to obtain
results quicker and to reduce the number of API calls. If you set the cache
directory to a permanent directory (the default is `tempdir()`), simfinapi will
be able to reuse this cache in subsequent R sessions.] globally before you start
downloading data. See `?sfa_set_api_key` and `?sfa_set_cache_dir` for details.

## Code of Conduct
Please note that the 'simfinapi' project is released with a [Contributor Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/matthiasgomolka/simfinapi/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Relation to `simfinR`

In case you also found `simfinR` ([CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=simfinR), 
[GitHub](https://github.com/msperlin/simfinR/)) you might want to know about the
differences between the `simfinapi` and `simfinR`. I tried to compile a list in 
[this issue](https://github.com/matthiasgomolka/simfinapi/issues/22#issuecomment-847270864).
